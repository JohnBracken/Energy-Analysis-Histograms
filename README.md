The following code does some additional work with the Toronto public building 
energy consumption data.  The data is imported into a table and histograms
are generated showing counts of average hours of energy consumption per week
for the approximately 1500 different operating sites.  I'm a bit skeptical that
there are only three different possible values for average energy consumption for all the
data, but that is what is shown in the table.  Histograms are generated using
the univariate procedure and the sgplot procedure.  Since there were only
3 different possible values, the histogram showing the counts of these values as a factor
variable showed the results the most clearly to me.
